Poietic Generator
=================

Requirements
------------

First, make sure you have a proper git, ruby & rubygems installation on your system.

If not, install them with :

    sudo apt-get install git-core ruby ruby-dev  

Then checkout the sources from the public repository :

    git clone https://github.com/Gnuside/poietic-generator.git


Installation
------------

We strongly recommand using a ruby environment wrapper like rbenv.

If not, you can try installing bundler with:

    gem install bundle

Then, install  headers packages required to build some gems :

    sudo apt-get install make libmysqlclient-dev libsqlite3-dev g++

Finally, from the project directory, run the following command to install
locally into the "vendor/bundle" directory the gems required by this project
and all their dependencies :

    bundle install


Configuration
-------------

Copy config/config.ini.example to config/config.ini then edit it to your needs.

Depending on your choices, you may need to install a database system with `apache phpmyadmin mysql-server-5.5`


Create a tmp directory locally. It will be use by the devel-script to run the service.


Running
-------

### Production mode

FIXME: 


### Development mode

Simply type the following command, from the project directory :

    bundle exec foreman start

Starting a new session
