Poietic Generator
=================

Installation
------------

### Requirements

First, make sure you have a proper git, ruby & rubygems installation on your system.

If not, install them with :

    $ sudo apt-get install git-core ruby ruby-dev  

Then checkout the sources from the public repository :

    $ git clone https://github.com/Gnuside/poietic-generator.git


### Setup

We strongly recommand using a ruby environment wrapper like rbenv.

If not, you can try installing bundler with:

    $ gem install bundle

Then, install  headers packages required to build some gems :

    $ sudo apt-get install make libmysqlclient-dev libsqlite3-dev g++

Finally, from the project directory, run the following command to install
locally into the "vendor/bundle" directory the gems required by this project
and all their dependencies :

    $ bundle install


### Configuration

Copy config/config.ini.example to config/config.ini then edit it to your needs.

Depending on your choices, you may need to install a database system with `apache phpmyadmin mysql-server-5.5`

Create a tmp directory locally. It will be use by the devel-script to run the service.


Running the server
------------------

Simply type the following command, from the project directory :

    $ bundle exec foreman start
